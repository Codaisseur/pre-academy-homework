# Further resources

We always get questions from future students regarding other resources in which they can follow as further preparation for the Academy. This is awesome as it's important to keep the ball rolling, especially if your Academy is month or more away from starting.

Sticking with the MDN theme, listed below is their learning pathways for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, that we recommend as an extension of further preparation:

- [HTML - Structuring the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML)
- [CSS - Styling the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)
- [JavaScript - Dynamic client-side scripting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

As the core of the Academy will cover JavaScript, if your short on time but still want to prepare further, focus your attention on the JavaScript pathway.

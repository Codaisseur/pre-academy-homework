# Deploying your website

To be able to share your personal webpage with everyone else, we need to deploy it to a hosting platform. In this case, we are going to use a free hosting platform called [Bitballoon](https://www.bitballoon.com/). Once you have added the final touches, please follow the instructions below to get your personal webpage up and running for all to see:

1. Go to [www.bitballoon.com](https://www.bitballoon.com/)

It's important that your `index.html` file resides in the root of your website folder or you will get an error when uploading to Bitballoon.

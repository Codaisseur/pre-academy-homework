# Deploying your website

To be able to share your personal webpage with everyone else, we need to deploy it to to hosting platform. In this case, we are going to use a free hosting platform called [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop). Once you have added the final touches, please follow the instructions below to get your personal webpage up and running for all to see:

1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop/)

2. Drag and drop your website folder to the indicated spot on the Bitballoon website

It's important that your `index.html` file resides in the root of your website folder or you will get an error when uploading to Netlify Drop.

3. Create a free account so your website will stay up for longer than 24 hours

4. Once you get access to Slack, share your website with your fellow classmates in your respective class channel.

# Homework Guidelines

For this assignment you will create a static webpage that is all about you. The webpage will need to include your name, an image of yourself and some background info about who you are. This information can be structured/presented any way you want, provided you stay within the arcs of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Where do I start?

![](https://cd.sseu.re/Getting_started_with_the_Web_-_Learn_web_development__MDN_2018-03-16_15-20-30.png)

You will be using MDN's [Getting started with the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) as a guide to assist in completing this assignment. You are expected to read all 8 sections of the tutorial and utilise any or all aspects within your assignment. You are however, **not** restricted to the confines of what is taught in this tutorial. This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a very basic website, which is the minimum you should aim to achieve for this assignment. Feel free to incorporate other aspects you may have learned somewhere else. Be creative and most of all don't be afraid to experiment!

### Exceptions to the tutorial

**Installing basic software - What tools do I actually need, right now?**

This section of the tutorial suggests some tools to install. We would rather have you install [some] of the tools we will be using during the program. This will give you the time now to get familiar if you haven't used them before. The tools below are the only tools you have to install for this section/assignment:

* [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

**Publishing your website**

This section of the tutorial suggests some hosting options once you have finished your website. Please read through it but do take note that we are going to cover this in the next section specifically for this assignment.

### When do I need to hand this in?

In the week(s) prior to your Academy start date, you will be invited to join a communication tool called Slack. It is during this time, **before** the start of your Academy, that we would like you to share the link to your website with your classmates in your respective class channel.

### What if I need help?

Whether it be now, during your training and well into your future career as a developer, being stuck happens. Luckily for you, you have the internet at your disposal! Our expectation should you get stuck, is that you make use of the tools at hand; one of the most important being the ability to Google your way out of it. This same expectation will continue throughout your Academy training as you will soon realise, a career in development means that help is not always available.

Once you have installed the tools you can access the MDN tutorial [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web).
